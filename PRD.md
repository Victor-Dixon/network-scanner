# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
The **Network Scanner** is an open-source toolkit for discovering devices, scanning ports and assessing vulnerabilities within a network. It currently supports ARP-based discovery, basic port scanning, banner grabbing and local vulnerability checks. This PRD formalizes the existing features and outlines future enhancements derived from `plans.txt`.

## Goals
- Provide accurate network discovery and port scanning.
- Support advanced security analysis such as anomaly detection and vulnerability assessment.
- Offer a user-friendly command line interface with extensibility for custom plugins.
- Maintain a lightweight codebase that can run on standard Python environments.

## Non-Goals
- The scanner is not intended for unauthorized network access or malicious use.
- It does not aim to replace full-featured enterprise security suites.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Network Discovery**
   - Scan a given IPv4 range using ARP to list active devices.
   - Output discovered device IP addresses in human-readable format.
2. **Port Scanning**
   - Scan common ports (default 1-1024) for each device.
   - Identify open ports and attempt banner grabbing when possible.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Maintain a local SQLite database of known vulnerabilities.
   - Provide a command-line option (`--vuln-check`) to query vulnerabilities for a service name and version.
4. **Threat Intelligence Lookup**
   - Integrate with AbuseIPDB to check whether an IP is associated with malicious activity.
   - Load the API key from environment variables.
5. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Include machine-learning models capable of learning normal patterns and flagging anomalies from network data.
6. **Reporting**
   - Format scan results and vulnerability findings for easy reading in the console.
7. **Extensibility**
   - Offer a plugin architecture so third parties can extend functionality without modifying core code.

## Roadmap
The project roadmap expands upon items listed in `plans.txt` and groups them into phases. Each phase represents a logical set of improvements:

### Phase 1 – Advanced Analysis
1. **Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection**
   - Collect a diverse dataset of normal and malicious traffic.
   - Evaluate supervised models for known threats and unsupervised models for new anomalies.
   - Integrate real-time and batch anomaly detection modes with feedback mechanisms for improving accuracy.
2. **IPv6 Support**
   - Implement IPv6 packet handling and address parsing.
   - Test the scanner in IPv6-enabled environments to ensure compatibility and security.
3. **Advanced OS Fingerprinting**
   - Enhance packet analysis using heuristics or ML to infer the operating system from subtle network signatures.
   - Maintain a regularly updated database of OS fingerprints.
4. **Encrypted Traffic Analysis**
   - Analyze metadata such as packet sizes and timing to infer activities within encrypted streams.
   - Collaborate with researchers to refine encrypted-traffic heuristics.

### Phase 2 – External Integrations
5. **Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms**
   - Connect to multiple threat feeds via APIs to cross-check IP addresses, URLs and file hashes.
   - Perform real-time queries so the scanner always uses up-to-date threat information.
6. **Automated Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Integrate with CVE/NVD and other databases to fetch vulnerability data automatically.
   - Automatically match discovered service versions to known vulnerabilities and report them.
7. **Scalability and Distributed Scanning**
   - Design a distributed architecture allowing multiple nodes to share scanning workloads.
   - Implement a central console for initiating scans and aggregating results.

### Phase 3 – Compliance and Usability
8. **Compliance and Reporting**
   - Generate customizable reports tailored to standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA and GDPR.
   - Provide built‑in checklists to simplify compliance audits.
9. **Customizable Scanning Profiles**
   - Allow users to create and save profiles specifying port ranges, scan intensity and compliance settings.
10. **Blockchain for Data Integrity**
    - Explore blockchain technology to log scan results, ensuring non‑repudiation and tamper resistance.
11. **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**
    - Build behavioral baselines for users and devices to identify suspicious deviations.
12. **Plugin Architecture**
    - Define plugin interfaces enabling external developers to add new detection modules or integrations.

## Success Metrics
- **Usability**: User can install and run scans with minimal configuration.
- **Accuracy**: High detection rate for open ports and known vulnerabilities with low false positives.
- **Extensibility**: New plugins can be added without changing core functionality.
- **Performance**: Scanning a typical /24 network should complete within a reasonable time (<5 minutes) on standard hardware.

## Appendix
- Current version of the scanner requires Python 3.8+ and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- All code is released under the MIT License.

## Defensive Deception Research

Future defensive research MAY include:

- honeypot telemetry
- deception environments
- padded-cell detection concepts
- simulated service layers
- anomaly-triggered alerting

Constraints:

- defensive only
- isolated environments only
- no offensive automation
- no persistence/exploitation tooling
- explicit authorization required
